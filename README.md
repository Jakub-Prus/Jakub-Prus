# Hi there! ðŸ‘‹  I'm Jakub Prus, a Frontend Developer with full-stack skills.

I have a growing interest and budding skills in creating simple, user-friendly interfaces that aim to offer a pleasant user experience. I'm continuously learning and adapting to improve my use of JavaScript and React, aspiring to build responsive and aesthetically appealing UIs while maintaining optimal performance.

While my primary focus is on the frontend, I've also gained some expirience in backend development with Node.js. I appreciate the comprehensive understanding this gives me of projects, as it helps to ensure smoother integration of all components.

Most importantly, I strive to adhere to principles of clean, scalable, and easy-to-understand code. I find that this not only helps me meet project goals, but it also promotes a healthier codebase, encouraging collaboration and making future enhancements more manageable.
